# Better-Vanilla
 A collection of minecraft java packs for 1.17.1 to improve the game's overall feel without making it overbearing.


Hello and welcome to better vanilla! 

This is a project designed on very minor reworks to the current game system to improve the general gameplay and feel of minecraft, From item reworks to texutre fixes and maybe the occasional 3d model where it suits.

The goal is to have a future-compatable hard to notice adjustment. Something you wont notice while you have it but youll notice it when its gone kinda thing. 

I hope you enjoy your time with better vanilla and thank you for checking it out! If you have any questions or suggestions be sure to post them here or message me on discord Xanthus58#3862
